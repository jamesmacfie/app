 - login should have it's own page and we should navigate there when a user isn't logged in (not just render it with the same url)
 - Test plan
 - Upload/select image
 - Default image schema
 - Image selection with paging
 - Think up flow for setting up networks/hubs etc
 - Finish user signup flow
 - Email notifications etc
 - Better CSS architecture
 - Assign users to networks (settings)
 - Have multiple roles for users
 - Set user email and password from settings page
 - Get user avatar from gravatar
 - Remove hub from network (settings) - warn about loss of sensor data
 - Better icons
 - A better 'No-network' UI (prob something a bit better for all error states)
 - Better model etc for sensor type data (icon, name, colour, etc)
