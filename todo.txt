 - login should have it's own page and we should navigate there when a user isn't logged in (not just render it with the same url)
 - login page shouldn't have the menu etc
 - logout should redirect to you a login page (with success message or something)
 - Get even more stripped down sensor summary for home page. Just latest temp || last movement etc
 - Rename and organise template partials
 - Test plan
 - Upload/select image
 - Default image schema
 - Image selection with paging
 - Think up flow for setting up networks/hubs etc
 - Finish user signup flow
 - Email notifications etc
 - Better CSS architecture
 - Assign users to networks (settings)
 - Have multiple roles for users
 - Set user email and password from settings page
 - Get user avatar from gravatar
 - Remove hub from network (settings) - warn about loss of sensor data
 - Better icons
 - A better 'No-network' UI (prob something a bit better for all error states)
 - Better model etc for sensor type data (icon, name, colour, etc)
 - Login
 - Forgot password stuff needs to be styled and work (might need the email stuff done first)
